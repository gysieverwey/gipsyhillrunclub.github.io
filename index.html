            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Gipsy Hill Running Club, where the pavement is our playground and the Gipsy Hill Taproom our post-run oasis. <br><br> Established in November 2019, just before the world hit pause, we've been pounding the streets and hitting our stride ever since.

But we're not just about the run â€“ oh no. We believe in the power of camaraderie and the joy of a well-deserved reward. That's why, after every run, you'll find us raising a glass and toasting to another successful Thursday.

<br><br>What started as a small gathering has blossomed into a bustling community. From seasoned veterans to fresh-faced newcomers, we welcome runners of all levels with open arms (and maybe a bit of friendly competition).

So, whether you're chasing a personal best or just looking for some company, join us at the Gipsy Hill Running Club. Because here, every run ends with a cheers, and every mile brings us closer together.</p>
